# 🎭 Task 06 – Deep Fake Interviews with Indian Cricket Legends

This project is part of Research Task 06 at Syracuse University iSchool.

## 🎯 Objective

Transform statistical cricket data and sports banter into fun **AI-generated interview skits**, using tools like LLMs, TTS voices, and AI reel makers.  
We creatively reimagine player comparisons (e.g., Kohli vs Sachin, Dhoni vs Rat) as **comedic “street interviews”** conducted by animals.

## 💡 Concept

> What if Indian cricket legends were interviewed on the streets of London by a monkey?
>
> 🐒: "Virat, the streets say Sachin’s still got more runs than you."
>  
> 🏏 Virat: "He does. But look at my chases, boss. I finished games."

We're using:
- 🧠 **LLMs** (ChatGPT, Claude) to write creative dialogues
- 📊 **Stat grounding**: factual support from ODI/Test datasets
- 🎙️ **Voice AI** (ElevenLabs) to generate character speech
- 🎥 **AI Video Editors** (CapCut, Luma AI) for creating animated clips
