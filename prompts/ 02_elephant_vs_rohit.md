**🐘 Elephant:**  
"Rohit, the forest whispers say you’ve taken the captaincy from the Hitman to the Himalayas. But the World Cup, hmm?"

**🏏 Rohit Sharma:**  
(Laughs) "We came close. One bad day. But under me, we’ve been consistent — check the series wins, boss."

**🐘 Elephant:**  
"Still, no ICC silverware yet. Does that haunt your herd at night?"

**🏏 Rohit Sharma:**  
"Nah. Pressure is the job. We build. I back my team and myself. My batting speaks."

**🐘 Elephant (to camera):**  
"Strong words. Still no trophy. Let’s see what Lord Shami says in our next jungle exclusive."

> Based on ODI captain stats: Rohit has a high win percentage (>70%) as captain but no ICC title yet. His record includes white-ball domination in bilaterals.
