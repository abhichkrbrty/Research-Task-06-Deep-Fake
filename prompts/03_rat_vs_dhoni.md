**🐀 Rat:**  
"Boss! Are you still the finisher or just farming now?"

**🧊 MS Dhoni:**  
(Smiles) "I finish what I start. Be it a chase or a field."

**🐀 Rat:**  
"People say your best years were 2007–2011. Helicopter shot retired too?"

**🧊 MS Dhoni:**  
"Helicopters don’t retire. They just fly lower."

**🐀 Rat:**  
"So if we need 16 in 6 balls today…?"

**🧊 MS Dhoni:**  
"Hand me the bat and move aside."

**🐀 Rat (to camera):**  
"And that’s that. Vintage Dhoni. Cool as ever. He may not play, but he’ll finish the reel."
