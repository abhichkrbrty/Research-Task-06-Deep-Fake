**🐒 Monkey:**  
"Aye Virat! Got a sec? Big question on everyone's mind — who's the real GOAT of ODI cricket? You or Sachin?"

**🏏 Virat Kohli:**  
(Laughs) "Depends who's asking — if it’s you, then me."

**🐒 Monkey:**  
"Sachin’s still ahead on total runs. What’s your defense?"

**🏏 Virat Kohli:**  
"He is. But I’ve chased down wins like nobody else. Look at match-finish stats."

**🐒 Monkey:**  
"Ahh the chase god, huh? What about elegance?"

**🏏 Virat Kohli:**  
"I’ll take effectiveness over elegance. Give me a target, I’ll hunt it down."

**🐒 Monkey (to camera):**  
"And there you have it folks. Straight from the chase-master. But Sachin fans, don’t rage just yet — we’re bringing him on next."
