🎥 Scene: London street, slight breeze. Monkey with mic stops Virat Kohli walking by.

🐒 Monkey:  
“Virat! Quick one. Who’s the real run king? You or Sachin?”

🏏 Virat (smirking):  
“He has the total. I have the chases.”

🐒 Monkey:  
“Ohhh. That’s a spicy take! But elegance?”

🏏 Virat:  
“Elegance doesn’t win games. Give me a target, I’ll hunt it.”

🐒 Monkey (to camera):  
“And there it is folks. From the chase god himself.  
Sachin fans — hold your comments — we’re bringing him next!”
