🎥 Scene: Outside Wankhede. Elephant with shades and a mic.

**🐘 Elephant:**  
"Rohit! Got a sec? People say you're the cool head. But did you really win *that many* as a captain?"

**🏏 Rohit Sharma:**  
"Cool head? I bring ice to fire. Asia Cup, IPLs, remember?"

**🐘 Elephant:**  
"Fair. But they say Dhoni’s the GOAT captain."

**🏏 Rohit Sharma:**  
"GOATs are legends. Elephants remember. I’m still building."

**🐘 Elephant (to camera):**  
"Measured words from Hitman. Respect for MSD, but he’s aiming to write his own legacy."
