🎥 Scene: Chennai streets. Rat with a collar mic and swagger.

**🐀 Rat:**  
"People say your best years were 2007–2011. Helicopter shot retired too?"

**🧢 MS Dhoni:**  
"Helicopters don’t retire. They just fly lower."

**🐀 Rat:**  
"So if we need 16 in 6 balls today…?"

**🧢 MS Dhoni:**  
"Hand me the bat and move aside."

**🐀 Rat (to camera):**  
"And that’s that. Vintage Dhoni. Cool as ever. He may not play, but he’ll finish the reel."
